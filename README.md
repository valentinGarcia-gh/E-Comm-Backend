## My Task

My task was to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the application's GET routes to return all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia Core:

![In Insomnia Core, the user tests “GET tags,” “GET Categories,” and “GET All Products.”.](./Assets/13-orm-homework-demo-01.gif)

The following animation shows the application's GET routes to return a single category, a single product, and a single tag being tested in Insomnia Core:

![In Insomnia Core, the user tests “GET tag by id,” “GET Category by ID,” and “GET One Product.”](./Assets/13-orm-homework-demo-02.gif)

The following animation shows the application's POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories being tested in Insomnia Core:

![In Insomnia Core, the user tests “DELETE Category by ID,” “CREATE Category,” and “UPDATE Category.”](./Assets/13-orm-homework-demo-03.gif)

Your walkthrough video should also show the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for products and tags being tested in Insomnia Core.

### Database Models

Your database should contain the following four models, including the requirements listed for each model:

* `Category`

  * `id`

    * Integer.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Set as primary key.
  
    * Uses auto increment.

  * `category_name`
  
    * String.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.

* `Product`

  * `id`
  
    * Integer.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Set as primary key.
  
    * Uses auto increment.

  * `product_name`
  
    * String.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.

  * `price`
  
    * Decimal.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Validates that the value is a decimal.

  * `stock`
  
    * Integer.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Set a default value of `10`.
  
    * Validates that the value is numeric.

  * `category_id`
  
    * Integer.
  
    * References the `Category` model's `id`.

* `Tag`

  * `id`
  
    * Integer.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Set as primary key.
  
    * Uses auto increment.

  * `tag_name`
  
    * String.

* `ProductTag`

  * `id`

    * Integer.

    * Doesn't allow null values.

    * Set as primary key.

    * Uses auto increment.

  * `product_id`

    * Integer.

    * References the `Product` model's `id`.

  * `tag_id`

    * Integer.

    * References the `Tag` model's `id`.

### Associations

You'll need to execute association methods on your Sequelize models to create the following relationships between them:

* `Product` belongs to `Category`, and `Category` has many `Product` models, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.

* `Product` belongs to many `Tag` models, and `Tag` belongs to many `Product` models. Allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products by using the `ProductTag` through model.
